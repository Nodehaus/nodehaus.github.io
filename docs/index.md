# Nodehaus AI Platform

## Own Your AI. Train and Deploy your Fine-Tuned Models.

At Nodehaus, we help organizations build and deploy their own AI models -
keeping your data and intellectual property exactly where they belong: with you.

[Contact us](https://www.nodehaus.io/#contact) for a demo, to discuss your use
case and to get access to our platform.

## Why do we build this?

AI models used in agents mostly perform repetitive tasks that small models can
perform a lot more economically than larger models. This approach is
[faster, saves money and reduces ecological impact](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/).

To maximize your custom models' performance in agentic systems, you need
training data - which is why we built a platform that allows you to create and
curate training data upfront and augment the data while your users interact with
the AI.

Apply the training data then to fine-tune a better model that you can download
or directly deploy in our infrastructure with an Open AI compatible endpoint.

Turn your AI interactions into small, custom models for agentic AI!
